# Introduction

As algebraic data types gain better support in C++ with facilities such as
`std::tuple` and `std::variant`, the importance of mechanisms to interact with
them have increased. While mechanisms such as `std::apply` and `std::visit`
have been added, they leave much to be desired. Pattern matching is a mechanism
that has been widely adopted across many programming languages. These include
text-based languages such as SNOBOL back in the 1960s, functional languages such
as Haskell and OCaml, and "mainstream" languages such as Scala, Swift, and Rust.

Inspired by P0095 [@P0095], which proposed pattern matching and language-level
variant simulteneously, this paper explores a possible full solution for pattern
matching only, and does not address language-level variant design. This is in
correspondence with a straw poll from Kona 2015, which encouraged exploration of
a full solution for pattern matching. SF: 16, WF: 6, N: 5, WA: 1, SA: 0.

# Motivation and Scope

Virtually every program involves branching on some predicates applied to a value
and conditionally binding names to its components for use in subsequent logic.
Today, C++ provides two types of selection statements which choose between one of
several flows of control: the `switch` statement and the `if` statement.
Since `switch` statements can only operate on a _single_ integral value and
`if` statements operate on an _arbitrarily_ complex boolean expression, there is
a significant gap between the two constructs even for inspection of 
the "vocabulary types" provided by the standard library such as `tuple`,
`variant`, `string`, and `vector`.

Consider a variable `p` of type `Point` and a function `position` which
prints whether `p` is positioned at the origin, on the _x_-axis or _y_-axis,
or not on any axes.

Structured binding declarations [@P0144] in C++17 introduced the ability to
concisely bind names to components of a value. Pattern matching aims to
naturally extend this notion by performing __structured inspection__ prior to
forming the __structured bindings__. The proposed direction of this paper is to
introduce an `inspect` statement as the third selection statement to fill
the gap between the `switch` statement and the `if` statement.

# Design Overview

## Basic Syntax

> | `inspect (` _init-statement~opt~_ _condition_ `) {`
> |     _pattern_ _guard~opt~_ `:` _statement_
> |     _pattern_ _guard~opt~_ `:` _statement_
> |     ...
> | `}`

## Basic Model

Within the parenthesis, the `inspect` statement is equivalent to `if` and
`switch` statements except that no conversion nor promotion takes place
in evaluating the value of its condition.

When the `inspect` statement is executed, its condition is evaluated and matched
against each pattern in order (first match). If a pattern is successfully
matched with the value of the condition, control is passed to the statement
following the matched pattern label. If there is a guard present, the boolean
expression must evaluate to true in order for control to be passed to the
statement following the label. If no pattern matches, then none of
the statements are executed.

A name introduced by a pattern is in scope from its point of declaration until
the end of the statement following the pattern label.

## Requirements

Each pattern enforces a set of compile-time requirements that, if violated,
results in the program being ill-formed.

## Primitive Patterns

### Constant Pattern

The constant pattern has the form:

> _constant-expression_

Let `c` be the constant pattern and `v` the value being matched.

_Requires:_ The expression `compare_3way(c, v)` must return `std::strong_equality`.

_Matches:_ If `compare_3way(c, v) == 0` is `true`.

```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
  inspect (n) {
    0: return 1;
//  ^ constant pattern
    _: return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

### Identifier Pattern

The identifier pattern has the form:

> unparenthesized _identifier_

Let `id` be the identifier pattern and `v` the value being matched.

_Requires:_ None.

_Matches:_ Any value `v`. `id` is an lvalue referring to `v`, and is in scope
from its point of declaration until the end of the statement following
the pattern label. This implies that identifiers cannot be repeated within
he same pattern but can reused in the subsequent pattern.

```cpp
int n = 101;
inspect (n) {
  x: cout << x; // prints 101
}
```

## Compound Patterns

### Structured Binding Pattern

The structured binding pattern has the form:

> `[`_pattern_~0~, _pattern_~1~, ..., _pattern_~N~`]`

Let `v` the value being matched.

_Requires:_ `std::tuple_size_v<std::remove_cv_t<decltype(v)>> == N`

_Matches:_ If _pattern_~i~ matches `GET<i>(v)` for all $0 \leq i < N$.

### Alternative Pattern

The alternative pattern has the form:

> `<Alternative>` _pattern_

Let `v` the value being matched and `V` be `std::remove_cv_t<decltype(v)>`.

_Requires:_
  - `std::variant_size_v<V>` is defined.
  - `discriminator(v)` is a valid expression returning an integral, enumeration,
    or a class type contextually convertible to an integral type.
  - `std::variant_discriminator_v<Alternative, V>` is defined and is an
    integral, enumaration, or a class type contextually convertible to
    an integral type.
  - `get<std::variant_discriminator_v<Alternative, V>>(v)` is defined.

_Matches:_ If `discriminator(v)` has the same value as
`std::variant_discriminator_v<Alternative, V>`, and
_pattern_ matches `get<std::variant_discriminator_v<Alternative, V>>(v)`.

```cpp
std::variant<T, U> v;
inspect (v) {
  <T> t: /* ... */
  <U> u: /* ... */
}
```

```cpp
const Base& b = /* ... */;
inspect (v) {
  <Derived1> d1: /* ... */
  <Derived2> d2: /* ... */
}
```

# Impact on the Standard

This is a language extension to introduce a new selection statement: `inspect`.

# Proposed Wording

# Design Decisions

## Conceptual Model: Extending Structured Bindings

The design intends to be consistent and naturally extend the notions introduced
by structured bindings. That is, The subobjects are __referred__ to rather than
being assigned into new variables.

## `inspect` vs `switch`

This proposal introduces a new `inspect` statement rather than trying to extend
the `switch` statement for the following reasons:

  - `switch` allows the `case` labels to appear anywhere, which hinders pattern
    matching's aim for __structured__ inspection.
  - The fall-through semantics of `switch` requires `break`
  - `switch` is purposely restricted to integrals for __guaranteed__ efficiency.
    The primary goal of pattern matching is expressivity, while being as
    efficient as hand-written code.

## Statement vs Expression

This paper diverges from P0095 [@P0095] in that it proposes to add `inspect` as
a statement only rather than trying to double as a statement and an expression.

The main reason here is that the semantic differences between the statement and
expression forms are not trivial.
  1. In the case where none of the cases match, the statement form simply skips
     over the entire statement Ã  la `switch`, whereas the expression form throws
     an exception since it is required to yield a value.
  2. Resulting type of the statement form of `inspect` within an immediately-
     invoked-lambda is required to be explicitly specified, or is determined by
     the first `return` statement. In contrast, the expression form will
     probably need to use `std::common_type_t<Ts...>` where `Ts...` are types of
     `N` expressions to be consistent with the ternary operator.

While an expression form of `inspect` would be useful, the author believes that
it can and should be introduced later, with different syntax such as
`x inspect { /* ... */ }`. The proposed syntax in this paper is consistent with
every other statement in C++ today.

## Language vs Library

There have been three popular pattern matching libraries in existence today.
  - Mach7
  - Simple Match by jbandela
  - MPark.Patterns

The issue of introducing identifiers is burdensome enough that I believe it
justifies a language feature.

# Examples

## Matching strings

```cpp
std::string s = "hello";
inspect (s) {
  "hello": std::cout << "hello";
  "world": std::cout << "world";
}
```

- Patterns are composed of compile-time values.
  - Optimization(?)
  - But if we keep the existing protocol, is this even possible?
  - We have to execute `operator==` which may not be `constexpr`.
  - Invocations of `get` cannot be counted, same as copy constructor
    calls cannot be counted due to optimizations.
- Syntax for matching `std::variant` and base class.
  - Given `inspect (v) { int n: stmt1; double d : stmt2;}`,
    `int n` and `double d` looks like declarations, but they are not.
- In order, determine if it's a match (e.g., dynamic type checking), then 
  transform (e.g., dynamic_cast), coupling the "is-as" pattern.
  So, given a string, why not match if it's the form of email, then transform,
  into 2 parts then continue matching?

  if (is_email(s)) {  // is
    auto [local, domain] = s;  // as
  }

```
  auto [__x, __y] = t;
  switch (__x) {
    case 0: {
